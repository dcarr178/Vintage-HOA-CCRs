# Governing Documents

This repository contains the governing documents for the Vintage On the River Homeowners Association with versioning that shows our original 1995 document and all modifications that have been made since.

There are two governing documents in this repository:

* Bylaws (Bylaws.md)

* Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions a.k.a. CC&Rs (CovenantsConditionsAndRestrictions.md)

### Staging Branch

The staging branch holds the current governing documents inclusive of the latest changes that have been voted on by the HOA membership.

### Master Branch

The master branch holds the current governing documents as recorded with the State of Utah. The staging branch will be merged into the master branch every time we record new governing documents with the State of Utah.

### Other branches

Additional branches should be created for every proposed line-item change to be voted on and then merged into the staging branch when/if approved by membership vote.
