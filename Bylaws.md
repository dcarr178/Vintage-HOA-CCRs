The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith, and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Association, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

##### Section 8.3 Expenses

To the extent that a trustee or officer of the Association has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 1 or 2 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorney's fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity for the determination as to the standard of conduct as provided in Section 4 of this Article.
